            Before reading this book, I recommend reading <a href = "https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2479408" class = "link">this</a> article.
            This article talks about some basics of the average period of production and its history. Average production is the idea in economics
            that it takes a certain amount of time to make certain goods. Some of those goods will be used to create other goods, ad infinitum. For example,
            a hoe is used to plant crops, but how do you make a hoe, and so on. The processes that take longer to produce a consumption good, are more
            profitable, because it doesn't make sense, to wait to get paid the same amount, than if you hadn't waited. There needs to be incentive to wait.

            This book is mainly an analysis and critique, by multiple authors, to understand Hayek's work on business cycles. Hayek believes that when the 
            nominal rate of investement falls below its natural rate, it becomes more profitable to get a loan, and start a capital producing operation. 
            This leads to more pursuing of 2nd or 3rd tier goods, which cannot be consumed. This is the boom. This then causes increases in the price of consumption goods
            because there are less of them to go around. This then causes forced saving, in which less money is driven into the economy because people have to spend more
            money on food. This is the bust. This then tends to cause businesses to go bankrupt, and have to pay back their loans, which they cannot do. This then causes
            bank runs the credit bubble to burst, which causes bank runs, and a decrease in the amount of money in circulation. This then drives the economy into an
            even worse spot.

            Hayek was focued on the theoretical explanations behind and the causes of business cycles. He put lots of work into trying to make peace with theories of equilbrium and the market. 
            He also tried to understand how you could combine a static system, with cyclic fluctations. This book goes into great detail in understanding and breaking down his arguments. 
            Overall, this is an intereisting book, if you want to know more about how Hayek though about business cycles. Though, this book is dense, and not recommended, unless you are an 
            academic or a large fan of Hayek.
