            This book is bad. 
            The only original thing about it is its bad ideas.
            I agree with the author on the New Green Deal and many left leaning ideas.
            The way he presents his ideas is impressively incompotent.
            His solution to infinite growth under capitalism and the problems that causes is degrowth.
            I think degrowth is needed at some point but being vague and confusing it not needed.
            His main idea is basically to change the definition of prosperity from a material ideal to a wellness ideal.
            I think that human wellness is important but when you try to solve a problem like this by changing definitions you actively limit the ability of people to communicate compotently.
            For example, you could theoretically fix homelessness by giving everyone a cardboard box then defining it as a mansion.
            Don't read this book.
