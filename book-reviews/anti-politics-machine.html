        <p class = "review">
            This book is a critique of the idea of devolpement, using the small state Lesotho, which is a landlocked country in South Africa.
            The introduction starts out with a exploration of the idea of devolpement.
            There are 2 common definitions used in relation to this word.
            The first use is associated with capitalism, and the global market.
            It supposes that a country is undeveloped if it is not a capitalist country and is exporting goods for the betterment of the rest of the world.
            The second definition is triumphed by some Neo-Marxists and is more in use today. 
            It deals more with the ideas of human well being and quality of life as things to be developed and improved.
            <br>
            <br>
            He then unearths the odd fact that academic discourse on Lesotho is very different than what is said by devolpement agencies. 
            The devolpement agencies are trying to paint the picture that Lesotho and its economy are mostly based on agriculture.
            They say things such as 70% of GNP are products of agriculture, when in reality it's only about 6%.
            They also are trying to show that if Lesotho just focused more onb agriculture then they would be able to increase the standards of living for everyone who lives there.
            They have been trying to push the government into supporting economic projects that involve farmland, especially that of some of the more mountainous regions.
            They also use really reliable statistics.
            They technically show that agricultural output has decreased siginificantly since 1950.
            The intereisting part is that in 1950 they had an extremely fruitful year, which may have, at least partially, been due to some counting errors.
            If you take the agricultural output from years before that, then there's no meaningful change, besides year to year deviations.
            They also say that most farming is done for subsistence and not to export.
            The odd part is that they don't tend to mention the extremely poor quality of the land for the use of farming. 
            Academic discourse shows that most of the GNP actually comes from the wages of the workers that migrate to South Africa for mining.
            This is in contrast to what is said by the devolpement agencies, who attempt to explain the economy without respect to its labor exports.
            When analyzing Lesotho, if you ignore its labor exports, its very easy to say that Lesotho is not developed.
            If you have brains or no ulterior motives, then you probably realize that Lesotho has a, at least partially, capitalist economy.
            They also have the ability to buy and trade goods with currency.
            When you examine the amount of food produced and the size of land plots, you quickly arrive at the conclusion that Lesotho can and does not subsist on just its agricultural output.
            There's a weird trend thats happening, mainly devolpement agencies are trying to demonstrate that Lesotho is a less developed country and needs it help to develop its farming.
            <br>
            <br>
            The author then talks about the livestock situation.
            He starts out with a question he asked to the the residents of Lesotho when he visited.
            He asked people wether they would rather have 150 dollars or a fine ox.
            Most people chose the money over the ox, some people even would rather take the money even when it was reduced to 50 dollars.
            This is odd because a fine ox could be sold to market for upwards of 300 dollars.
            He was curious about whether or not people knew that they could make more money from selling the ox than taking the flat rate of money.
            These people then demonstrated that they would receive more total money if they sold the ox than if they were to take the money.
            He then explains how cattle are seen in this culture.
            Men often go away for work in South Africa but are eventually fired because they are too old, which often means they are worth employing, with respect to the current young men.
            In order to store up money for when they don't have a job they buy some cattle.
            They are fired and are able to sell this cattle to pay for food and clothes, which are the only valid reasons for selling cattle.
            They also are given a small plot of land, but the amount of resource they get from that is barely worth mentioning.
            In essence, these cattle act as a type of retirement fund for the poeple of Lesotho.
            He has named this phenomenon the Bovine Mystique.
            <br>
            <br>
            The livestock situation isn't as cut and dry as a fancy retirement fund.
            Since women make very little compared to migrant workers they seek to get access to some of the money the men bring home.
            They do this through marriage.
            You also need to understand that if the husband brings home money, it is the property of the family.
            Livestock are the one good that are free from being sold, unless there are dire circumstances, which means the husband has full control over them.
            The older generations also benefit from men having livestock, mainly through bridewealth.
            When a man wants to marry someone he has to pay the bride's parents in order to marry her.
            This is kind of like redistribution from the wealthy to the poor because old people have limited resources compared to the young.
            There is also a social aspect to this idea.
            You are able to lend people cattle for work they need to do, like ploughing their fields.
            It's one way to show that you are part of the community while not being physically in the community.
            There's a social wealth that's given by lots of cattle, you are often seen as more famous or socially ideal if you have lots of livestock as compared to lots of money.
            <br>
            <br>
            He then explains what crop and livestork measures the program sought to implement.
            For livestock, they would try to cull a lot of animals and set aside certain plots for grazing.
            The killing of many animals is important because there are too many livestock for the amount of pasture in Lesotho.
            This would matter if people actually intended to make money of their cattle.
            The land that was not used for grazing would not be allowed for use by anyone so it could recover from the grazing.
            As for the crops, they would try to move people from subsistence crops to cash crops, so they could make more money.
            They would also like to have control of the land of farmers as to better prepare the land for crops.
            They would do such things as spray weedkiller and specify what types of farming practices were most effective.
            <br>
            <br>
            All of these things come together, in the anti-politics machine.
            What the program is trying to do is, by definition, political. 
            I don't think you could argue that policies passed by government in order to help the production of cash crops and livestock are non political.
            Often the measures that the program supported, as a side effect, would increase the power of the government.
            At the least, they would gather together the power already in the country into an even smaller number of hands than it currently is.
            They are basically cutting out the people in the process of government.
            The author then goes on to mention other countries in Africa where there were devolpement projects.
            From this, he was able to conlude, that in these other countries there were the same types of things happening.
            Namely, a incredbly incompotent analysis of the situation and procedures to fix the problems that were uncovered.
            These solutions also often lead to a reinforcement of the power of the government in power.
            <br>
            <br>
            In the epilogue, the author makes sure that we understand that he is not against helping people, or that people starving is good.
            He takes a, in his own words, left-populist approach to devolpement.
            He also feels that many other anthropologists and academcis share similar views about helping other people.
            These ideas seek to, first off, understand the situatuon better, by talking to people who actually live there.
            Through this, you will be able to understand what the problems actually are. 
            He also likes helping the people on the ground more than he likes government policies.
            Helping people directly is also less likely to result in overreliance on government, especially if that government is corrupt.
            All in all, this book was pretty easy to read and has some good points.
            Although, i do disagree with him, in regard to government policies.
            I feel that some policies will be able to help the disadvantaged but we do need to be careful.
            I also feel that some devolpement agencies, specifically those that try to cure diseases are in a different class, and actually help people.
