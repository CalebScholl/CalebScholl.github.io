        <p class = "review">
            I feel that this book was written exactly for people like me. This book has serious scientific answers to absurd questions like, what happens
            if you pitch a baseball at 90% of the speed of light? Apparently you would turn a lot of the air into plasma and probably set surrounding detritus on fire.
            This book compotently combines real scientific explanations with lighthearted jokes, without comprimising the intelluctual material he is trying to cover.
            <br>
            <br>
            I sincerely recommend this book, for anyone who has asked, but what about this? This is a wild journey into stupid questions that are politely answered with
            more respect than they deserve. This book is comedy gold and one of my favorite books I have ever read.
