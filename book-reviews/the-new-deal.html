            This book explains, in great detail, the policies that made up the New Deal program of US President Franklin Roosevelt. 
            This book looks at each policy in detail and examines its influences and the people surrounding it. 
            <br>
            <br>
            His handling of the banking crisis during his first hundred days could have been worse. 
            He basically entered the presdidency during a financial crisis.
            The main problem was that there was not trust in the banks, so a lot of runs happened.
            This led to not enough money in the economy to circulate goods. 
            He started out with a bank holiday, in order to buy some time so he could formulate a plan to tackle this problem.
            One of the problems wityh this approach was that, since no one could exchange money for goods, some people gave IOUs, because they thought that this would not last very long.
            When it didn't immeaditly fix the economy, people began to exchange goods with other goods, and America became a barter econmomy. 
            His plan was to allow Federal Reserve banks to issue banknotes. 
            During this time period, the dollar was still backed by gold, so bills that were not backed by gold, were called greenbacks.
            After putting together some complicated legislation, Roosevelt opened a few banks.
            He would ensure that every bank that opened would not crash.
            Since then, but not including the 2008 financial crisis, only a few banks have failed, which compared to previous rates was a tremendous improvement.

            His policy that gave people jobs, if they were willing to work was interiesting. 
            He wanted to hire specifically young men, to do simple tasks around the country that would benefit the public good.
            These included public works projects like dams, streets, and railroads. 
            One large and very important part of this was his work on the national parks. 
            He would send camps of people into the national parks, who were managed by members of the army. 
            He often went to visit these camps and have lunch with them, he felt that this better connected him to his people. 
            Overall, this program was very effective at increasing patriotism among the people that participated. 
            In retrospect, this was very beneficial to solider morale when WWII rolled around.

            Throughout this book it may have seemed that all these policies have worked well together. 
            That is not the case and was shown in the recession of 1937.
            This recession lasted approximately 13 months.
            During this time many people lost their jobs and economic output fell substantially.
            Business conservatives blamed this on his policies that put more strain on businesses which led to decreased private invesetment.
            Others also blamed the high taxes that were instituted to fund the many pet projects of Roosevelt, especially Social Security.
            While at the same time Keynesians blamed the budget cuts to public works projects for the recession.
            I think a more likely explanation were a blend of all of these factors.
            Higher taxes for all and more regulations made it harder for businesses to increase their output.
            This also led to unemployement because they had to follow laws like a minimum wage and a limited work week.
            The more conservative members of the government also pushed for budget cuts to the public works which also made people lost their jobs or get paid less.
            This led to less money in the economy and demand for goods fell, so there was a mild self reinforcing cycle.
            Thankfully the recession did not last very long and experienced a quick bounce back.
            <br>
            <br>
            Overall, this book was written with accurate information and kept me interested the whole way through.
            I also enjoyed how he highlighted the people behind the policies and some backstory on them.
            I also think it shows attention to detail for highlighting the affects that these policies had in many different aspects of American life.
            I do think he spent a little too much time on the Federal Theater and the Federal Writers but this is more fishing for bad things to say rather than something horrible that completely ruined the book.
