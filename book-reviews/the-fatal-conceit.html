            This main point of this book is socialism bad.
            It doesn't just try to disprove the main theories of socialism but also ideas that those theories are founded on.
            The term fatal conceit is referring to the limits of rationalism.
            In his first chapter he talks about what lies in between instinct and reason, which is tradition.
            I will be using the terms reason and rationalism interchangabley.
            <br>
            <br>
            He explains the devolpement of traditions and ethics as well as how societies have developed.
            He is able to highlight the reason that we were able to improve our lives and live in bigger groups was want for property rights.
            This want for property rights lead to the creation of a government that was able to protect those property rights.
            These rights allowed us to quickly develop and take over the planet.
            He also shows that traditions develop through an evolutionary process, which sounds similar to memetic theory.
            We discard and add new ideas to our traditions as we develop as a society.
            This leads to better and better traditions which do not have a purely rational base, which means under rationalism we should abandon our traditions.
            He also lumps ethics under traditions which is an intereisting distinction.
            This makes sense when you consider that he looks at traditions through a historical perspective and how they have changed over time.
            This idea is supported by traditional values that hunter/gatherer societies tend to hold. 
            For example, in many hunter gatherer societies there is no strong government or property rights.
            This doesn't allow for increase in capital and things are shared in communitty.
            Therefore, the ethics of this society prefer altrustic ideals and equality.
            I have heard materialist analyses of this same idea that takes a similar take.
            Instead of property rights giving way to government it upholds the idea that the material conditions didn't allow for very much concentraction of wealth.
            These material conditions were scarcity of resources and/or the technology to exploit the resources.
            You also couldn't hold onto items for very long unless you were able to carry them, hunter gatherer tribes tended to be very nomadic.
            <br>
            <br>
            He tries to show the limits of reason as they refer to society.
            If we care about being completely reasonable similar to Descartes, then we should get rid of most of what our society is based on.
            Even some of scientific thought and rationality is part of tradition.
            Why should we even pursue things that are 100% rational?
            In most cases these things don't exist or are unrealistic in practice.
            I really enjoy this book even though I disagree with the author's ideas. The author is a very talented writer and his reasoning is solid.
