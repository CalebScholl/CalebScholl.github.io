            TL;DR Affluent Americans have a bigger effect on policy than poor Americans.
            <br>
            <br>
            The main premise of the book is that democracy in America is not equally responsive to its citizens.
            He shows that when rich people and poor peopple disagree on a policy more often that not rich people get their way.
            One important to say is that equality of outcome is not ideal.
            For example, if you tried to garuntee the same outcome for a genius as you did for someone of average intelligence that wouldn't be fair.
            Imagine giving  someone who knows very little about math the same job as someone who has PHD level knowledge about math.
            Or the opposite, imagine giving someone who doesn't need help understanding math help with math, it would be a waste of resources.
            For some peculiar reason the author never considers the possibility that those who are more affluent have better ideas then poor people.
            When I say affluent I'm referring to the top 10% of the population with regard to income.
            Affluent people tend to hold more conservative ideas about the economy but more liberal ideas about social problems, like abortion or gay people.
            For the record, I agree with the author on a lot of his points, and that we should try to increase democratic responsiveness to everyone unless their ideas aren't viable.
            <br>
            <br>
            This book does contain a lot of math and statistics that I lack the knowledge to verify or disprove.
            He then argues that even though poor people often have less time and energy to care about politics they vote quite well.
            He attributes that to the fact that poor people tend to look to their peers who devote their time and energy to researching politics.
            Those people that have opinions about policies will try to explain their stance and reasons for and against said policies which will also increase the average compotence of society.
            There is also the law of large numbers which is also beneficial to lots of people.
            The average American citizen is unlikely to hold concrete and well formed opinions about a large number of disparate policies.
            As long as there are some people who care about every policy the public will tend to vote compotently.
            <br>
            <br>
            He then goes on to explain the link between public preference and policies getting passed.
            He shows that when the majority of Americans have a certain preference, policies that support those preferences tend to get passed.
            There is not a 100% correlation between overwhelming preference and policies that are enacted. 
            This is because the politicans who actually vote and decide policy won't necessarily share the same viewpoints as their constituents.
            Said politicans may also hold a personal stake in some of these policies, for example business taxes or regulations, which may affect they way they will vote.
            He also explains that there are some policies that govern internal affairs of the governing body, like vacation days, that are more administrative and unimportant to the average citizen.
            These policies can, for the most part, be disregarded because they have little affect on the public.
            <br>
            <br>
            He then covers the topic of interest groups and the effect that they have on policy.
            He shows that interest groups are better at stopping policies from getting passed than helping policies to get passed.
            If you have 3 to 4 net interest groups that oppose a certain policy it has about a 15% chance to pass.
            On the other end if you have a few net interest groups that are campainging for a certain policy is had about a 35% chance to pass.
            These statistics are also only taking into account interest groups that are well established and have had large support of at least one group of people.
            Interest groups have a suprisingly small effect, in relation to the effects of class, on public policy.
            <br>    
            <br>
            In one of the last chapters he shows how changes in the majority and election years have on democratic responsiveness.
            Fun Fact: Republican presidents tend to have greater democratic responsiveness than Democratic presidents.
            He demonstrates that the longer a president is in office the more their democratic responsiveness decreases.
            He also shows that democratic responsiveness is highest in election years.
            This makes sense because citizens are more likely to remember more recent policies rather than those that were instituted less recently.
            He also argues that gridlock incrases responsiveness.
            This claim is a bit odd, but it makes sense if you think in terms of quality rather than quantity.
            Fewer policies will be passed during times of gridlock
            <br>
            <br>
            This book would be rated a little higher if the statistics weren't so boring and the author was a little more intellectually honest.
            I would be careful about trusting this book to much but overall I agree with what it has to say.
            For example <a href = "https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/abs/relative-policy-support-and-coincidental-representation/BBBD524FFD16C482DCC1E86AD8A58C5B" class = "link">this</a> article attempts to show that this books main premise is wrong.
            This book has gotten me interested in reading the Myth of the Rational Voter and Friendly Fascism to give me different perespectives on democracy in America.
