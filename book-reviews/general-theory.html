            A small preface to this review. 
            This book is pretty dense and not for the faint of heart.
            The author also includes a disclaimer that you may not understand if you are more of a layperson.
            I would not recommend this book unless you are specifically on the foundation that keynes builds his ideas.
            <br>
            <br>
            He starts out with talking about the how his main focus in this text is the general case of certain economic phenomena rather than special cases. 
            He follows this up by talking about the 2 main types of unemployement voluntary and involuntary, respectively.
            Frictional unemployement is more a consequence of living in a imperfect system than the fault of any party.
            Some common types of frictional unemployement may include trying to find a job in a field that you recently got fired from instead of getting a job in fast food or the like.
            This could also take the form of wages not being extended down far enough because of collective bargaining. 
            This is the case sometimes because businesses want to pay the minimum amount possible and at that wage they would also have more capital to hire more workers.
            Voluntary unemployement is a little bit different in the case that the individual is not working for a multitude of reasons.
            The main reason given by Keynes is that when the marginial disutility of your labor is greater than the wage you may receive.
            This makes it not worth your time to work at the job.
            Another possibility for not working could be unemployement benefits, especially if those benefits are greater than the wage that you would have otherwise received.
            One reason not stated that may fit is that of a disability, you may be able to work but the effort required and time spent may outweigh the wage that you are payed.
            His last statement in this chapter revolves around the nominal and the real wage.
            The nominal wage is the number amount of money you are payed, e.g. 20 dollars an hour. 
            The real wage is a more abstract concept that refers more to the amount of goods that you can buy with the amount of money you make.
            For example 1 dollars an hour sounded pretty good in 1800, but nowadays with inflation and other effects that have raised the price of goods, 1 dollar an hour is very little.
            He also bring up that labor/labor unions really only set the nominal wage. 
            Nowadays, we do have unions calling for "living wages" which is kind of a call to real wages, but more often you see people talking about a rise in the nominal price, e.g. 20 dollars an hour to 25.
            <br>
            <br>
            One concept that this author stresses is the idea that marginal wages are at a maximum equal to the marginal disutility of labor.
            This effectively sets the maximum amount of possible employement, which may correspond to "full employement".
            This is the case because you can only hire so many people given a minimum and maximum wage, and a set amount of capital.
            He then leads into the idea of how investement affects employement wheich then affects consumption.
            Investement basically increases the amount of capital that employers can spend toward employees and cet. par. employement increases.
            You need money in order to buy and then consume goods which is gained from a job.
            This is why some amount of investement is helpful for growth of industry and jobs.
            One very irionic statement made by Keynes near the end of this chapter talks about how 
            Ricardos ideas were suited to the economic climate of the time period around 1800 but fails to recognize that the success of his own ideas was, 
            at least partially due to the economic climate that he lived in.
            This leads to the question of why shouldn't we just be constantly moving labor around to the most efficent activity?
            This is because at first a growing industry will want to pull in workers or goods that will create the the most efficent production of goods.
            Since there are not an infinite amount of resources that are well suited to that particular industry this will lead to less and less efficent resources that are pulled into said industry.
            This is easily summed up by the idea of diminishing returns.
